# MedievalProstheticsPatch 1.3
Medieval Prosthetics Patch for Medieval Overhaul (Rimworld)

Medieval Prosthetics is a collection of prosthetic limbs that are a fusion of reality and fantasy to give more prosthetic options to medieval runs, originally created by Nuno.

This is an update of an existing patch (Medieval Prosthetics Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul and Rimedieval) I made for Nuno's Medieval Replacements mods, as well as Awan's Chirurgie Patch which also affects those mods. The goal was to make them more compatible with SirLalaPyon's Medieval Overhaul and my own gameplay style. I spoke to all parties and got permission to do this.

I also plan to incorporate certain elements of Apothecary (Continued) with permission from Mlie.

Load after Medieval Overhaul, Medieval Prosthetics, Medieval Medicines, and Chirurgie Patch.

Thanks to SirLalaPyon, Nuno, Awan, Ogam, TruGerman, dltslt, SirMashedPotato and Mlie for all of their mods and their help.

What this mod does:

- Updates components in Medieval Prosthetics recipes to use Basic Components from MO instead of industrial components. 

- Adds emerald as an ingedient in Ambroisen Prosthetic Limbs. These limbs are meant to be imbued with magical energy. The magical properties of the emerald are the ingredient that allows a man-made prosthetic to function equivalent to a natural limb. 

- Sensory Ambroisen Prosthetics can actually restore sight, hearing and smell, also thanks to the magical properties of the emerald. They may not be on par with a natural eye, ear or nose, but they will allow your pawn to function mostly normally again. Increased component cost in recipe to account for this.

- Made prosthetics recipes stuffable where possible so you can choose which materials to use.

- Research projects and tabs were reworked by Awan in the Chirurgie Patch, which is now required. Work ticks needed to craft prosthetics and medicine has also been adjusted by this patch.

- Added support for all of Medieval Overhaul's alcoholic items to work as ingredients when creating medicines that require alcohol. Various alcohols from Morrowrim - Alcohol Remade are also supported but mod is not required. There is also support for VFE Medieval's Wine, VFE Settlers' Chemshine and VFE Vikings' Mead, but none of them are required either.

- All Medieval Medicines are craftable at the Drug Lab, Medieval Overhaul Workbench, and Crafting Spot.

- All Medieval Prosthetics are craftable at the Medieval Overhaul Workbench and Crafting Spot.

- Prosthetics should now satisfy Transhumanist trait.
