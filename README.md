Medieval Prosthetics Patch for Medieval Overhaul (Rimworld)

Medieval Prosthetics which is a collection of prosthetic limbs that are a fusion of reality and fantasy to give more prosthetic options to medieval runs, originally created by Nuno.

This is an update of an existing patch (Medieval Prosthetics Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul and Rimedieval) I made for Nuno's Medieval Replacements mods, as well as Awan's Chirurgie Patch which also affects those mods. The goal was to make them more compatible with SirLalaPyon's Medieval Overhaul and my own gameplay style. I spoke to all parties and got permission to do this.

I have also incorporated certain elements of Apothecary (Continued) with permission from Mlie.

Load after Medieval Overhaul, Medieval Prosthetics, Medieval Medicines, Entosomnia - Medieval Cryptosleep, and Chirurgie Patch.

What this mod does:

- Updates components in Medieval Prosthetics recipes to use Basic Components from MO instead of industrial components. 

- Adds emerald as an ingedient in Ambroisen Prosthetic Limbs. These limbs are meant to be imbued with magical energy. The magical properties of the emerald are the ingredient that allows a man-made prosthetic to function equivalent to a natural limb. 

- Sensory Ambroisen Prosthetics can actually restore sight, hearing and smell, also thanks to the magical properties of the emerald. They may not be on par with a natural eye, ear or nose, but they will allow your pawn to function mostly normally again.

- Research projects and tabs were reworked by Awan in the Chirurgie Patch, which is now required. Work ticks needed to craft prosthetics and medicine has also been adjusted by this patch.

- Added support for all of Medieval Overhaul's alcoholic items to work as ingredients when creating medicines that require alcohol. Various alcohols from Morrowrim - Alcohol Remade are also supported but mod is not required.

- Scar cream from Apothecary (Continued) has been added, which is a way to remedy your colony's various scars. Apothecary is not required, but if you choose to install it there should be no conflict with this mod.

- All Medieval Medicines and Scar Cream are craftable at the Drug Lab, Medieval Overhaul Workbench, and Crafting Spot.

- All Medieval Prosthetics are craftable at the Medieval Overhaul Workbench and Crafting Spot.
